# CASHEWNUT-CUTTER
● The objective of this project was to develop a new instrument and technique for processing the Cashew Nut shell. ● The objective was staged after conducting a survey of the local farmers. ● Design for Cashew nut shell cutter was modeled in CATIA V6. ● The model of cutter was then processed in CNC machine to obtain the require couture. ● The couture cutting path was decided using G and M codes. ● The body of the fixture was fabricated using gas welding process.  ● It was a community project taken after conducting a survey of the local farmers. ● This instrument reduced the cutting period by 30% as compared to the conventional cutting instruments and as a result we received a demand for its commercial production.  Softwares, Technologies and Tools :CATIA V6, CNC Machine, G Codes and M Codes, Gas Welding.
